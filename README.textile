h1. Sinatra-REST

Actually it's a set of templates to introduce RESTful routes in Sinatra. The 
only thing for you to do is to provide the views. The routes and some 
url helpers will be provided behind the scenes.


h2. Installation

Guess what!

    #sudo gem source --add http://gems.github.com
    #sudo gem install blindgaenger-sinatra-rest


h2. Usage

Of course you need to require the gem in your Sinatra application:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'sinatra/rest'

It's very similar to defining routes in Sinatra (@get@, @post@, ...). But this 
time you don't define the routes by yourself, but use the model's name for 
convention.

For example, if the model's class is called @Person@ you only need to add this 
line:

    rest Person

Which will add the following RESTful routes to your application. (Note the 
pluralization of @Person@ to the @/people/*@ routes.)

* GET    /people
* GET    /people/new
* POST   /people
* GET    /people/:id
* GET    /people/:id/edit
* PUT    /people/:id
* DELETE /people/:id

But the real benefit is, that these *routes define a restful standard behaviour* 
on your model, *appropriate routing and redirecting* and *named url helpers*. 

For instance, you can imagine the following code to be added for the @/people@ 
and @/people/:id@ routes.

<pre><code>
# simply add this line

rest Person, :renderer => :erb

# and this is generated for you

get '/people' do
  @people = Person.all
  erb :"people/index", options
end

put '/people/:id' do
  @person = Person.find_by_id(params[:id])
  redirect url_for_people_show(@person), 'person updated'
end

# further restful routes for Person ...
</code></pre>

That's only half the truth! The routes are generated dynamically, so all 
defaults can be overridden (the behaviour, after/before callbacks, used renderer, 
which routes are added).
